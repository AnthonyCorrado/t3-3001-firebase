## Play the game that is changing the world you and I live in.

Critics are calling it the Shawshank Redemption of tic tac toe. 

## Game Play

The match is based on a main game clock and player shot clocks . The board consists of 24 playable squares, with only nine active at a time. After a set period of time the game board gradually begins to move. Players alternate turns placing their marker in the 9-block active grid in attempts to score 3-in-a-row. Unlike traditional TTT, the game does not end after a score. The player receives a point and the game continues. Points can be score regardless of whether all three squares are active at the time. 

## Conclusion

When the final nine blocks are filled or the timer reaches 0 the game is over. The score is then tallied and a winner is determined. 

## What Was Used:

The meat: JavaScript and Angular. The potatoes: CSS and Foundation 5.
